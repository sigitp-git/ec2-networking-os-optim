Ensure that your reserved kernel memory is sufficient to sustain a high rate of packet buffer allocations (the default value may be too small).

Open (as root or with sudo) the /etc/sysctl.conf file with the editor of your choice.

Add the vm.min_free_kbytes line to the file with the reserved kernel memory value (in kilobytes) for your instance type. As a rule of thumb, you should set this value to between 1-3% of available system memory, and adjust this value up or down to meet the needs of your application.

vm.min_free_kbytes = 1048576

Run myapp on cpus 2,4,6,8 and allocate memory only to local memory where the process runs.
$numactl -l --physcpubind=2,4,6,8 myapp

Run multithreaded application myapp with its memory interleaved on all CPUs to achieve balanced latency across all application threads.
$numactl --interleave=all myapp

Run process on cpus that are part of node 0 with memory allocated on node 0 and 1.
$numactl --cpunodebind=0 --membind=0,1 myapp

- numa_hit is the number of allocations which were intended for that node and succeeded there.
- numa_miss shows the count of allocations that were intended for this node, but ended up on another node due to memory
constraints.
- numa_foreign is the number of allocations that were intended for another node, but ended up on this node. Each numa_foreign
event has a numa_miss on another node.
- interleave_hit is the count of interleave policy allocations which were intended for a specific node and were successful.

- local_node is a value that is incremented when a process running on the node allocated memory on the same node.

- other_node is incremented when a process running on another node allocated memory on that node.

Where:
- N<node>=<pages>: pages mapped by this process only in various numa nodes. Example N0=178, N2=4. Means 178 pages are allocated on Node0 and 4 pages on Node2.
- file: backing store for the memory area. If pages are generated due to COW pages, then there will anon pages. - heap: process heap area
- stack: process stack area
- huge: huge pages mapped in process area
- anon<pages>: anonymous pages
- dirty<pages>: modified or dirty pages
- mapped <pages>: mapped pages from the backing store. Only shown if different from the count of anon and dirty pages
- mapmax<count>: Number of processes mapping this page. Sign of sharing of memory area.
- swapcache<count>: Number of pages that have an associated entry on a swap device
- active<pages>: Number of pages in the active list. if count is shown that there may some inactive pages exist in the memory
area that may have get removed by swapper soon.
- writeback<pages>: Number of pages that are currently in process of written out.
